### 2. Abstract

We have chosen the broken line chart of China's real-time carbon data for visual analysis. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas that causes global warming. We analyzed the broken line chart of China's carbon dioxide emissions during the period from the outbreak of covid-19 in China at the beginning of the year until the epidemic was gradually controlled in China. We think it is very meaningful to analyze this picture. Carbon monitoring is an international initiative, and regular updating of carbon monitoring data will give us a better understanding of how policy actions and economic changes, energy prices, holidays, weekends and weather control CO2 emissions. In order to better study the impact of the epidemic on carbon dioxide emissions, we analyzed the data types, visual variables, etc., and analyzed the relevant cognitive theory. We also found some visualization problems in the graph and made some modifications to make this line chart more in line with the specification requirements of information visualization.

### 3. Introduction

According to the Convention of the past years, from the middle of January to the middle of February belongs to the Spring Festival period in China. During this period, many factories will shut down during holidays, so carbon dioxide emissions will be greatly reduced. After the middle of February, carbon dioxide emissions will gradually increase until they return to normal.
However, the covid-19 epidemic broke out in China at the end of January this year, and the Chinese government adopted strict blockade measures in early February, including factory shutdown, school suspension of offline teaching, traffic restriction, etc. These measures continued until March, when the epidemic was effectively controlled in China. As a result, China's carbon dioxide emissions this year did not return to normal until April.
